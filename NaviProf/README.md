This is implementation of "instrumentor" gradle-plugin where all the tasks are built-in, so you only have to apply plugin in app's build.gradle, run "UploadArchive", move revceived 'repo' folder to app and run something like:
gradle Profile -Ptest_apk_path=app/build/outputs/apk/androidTest/debug/app-debug-androidTest.apk -Papk_path=app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk -Ptest_paths=NavigationTest,AnotherTest
